Say approximately how many hours you have spent completing the assignment.

Ans: About 15 - 20 hours. It took me the whole weekend to read, learn about
Google API, familiarize with JS, write the program, and test functionality.

There were plenty of head scratching moments , particularly with asynchronous
requests and use of the response results in various functions.
