##Lab : Finalizing your learning portfolio

1.  What is the purpose of this GitHub Repository?

    This online repo will be used to share projects of 
    personal interest.

2.  What was your favorite lab or assignment and why?  

    My favorite assignment was the Client Assignment. 
    This was the first project in this class where I transitioned from
    simple standalone HTML files to an actual project that interacted with a 
    a server backend and used an interactive client front-end. 
    I also enjoyed being creative in customizing the map and marker layout.

3.  How much do you think you have grown from day 1 of this course to now?  

    I started this course knowing a bit about HTML & CSS. I personally took the
    time to study JavaScript from Jon Duckett - Javascript, HTML, CSS. I 
    also enrolled and almost completed an online MOOC concurrently : 
    https://www.coursera.org/learn/html-css-javascript-for-web-developers
    This is offered by John Hopkin's University and was a good compliment to
    the first part of this course. The security issues discussed and the final 
    Assignment has got me interested in taking more courses in this topic.
    I believe I have improved in being more proactive and taking responsibility
    for my own learning - watching online tutorials, FAQs etc. and trying
    to understand material on my own.

4.  What was the most important thing that you learned in this course? 
    Cite two examples as evidence.  

    To submit/publish work that can be held to high professional standards.
    Ming warned about leaving console print statements in submitted code and
    awarded a zero if found. I personally lost points when I used a default parameter
    setting in my server assignment copied from the specifications. I am taking Comp40 
    next semester and it was good to have this mindset drilled in.

    I will also start considering the many security issues and vulnerabilities when designing
    future projects. I am currently also reading Brian Krebs' book - **Spam Nation - The Inside Story of Organized Cybercrime**.


5.  Now that you have finished the course, what topic would you like to delve deeper into?  
    
    * I would like to go deeper both into the backend and front end.
    * I am interested in UI design and considerations.
    * I am also interested in taking a more comprehensive course on security; though I'm undecided
    on continuing on at Tufts after my Post Bac and for my Masters.
