            <hr>

            <p>
                The objective of this project is to test and document security flaws found in a web application 
                developed by a colleague (Grace) as part of Assignment 2 (Client Side) and Assignment 3 (Server Side) for Comp-20 : Web Programming. 
                My goal is to carry out a basic first-run penetration test to discover security flaws in this particular
                implementation and to document the test results. 
            </p>

            <p>The user's application (also known hereafter as "app") consists of the following:
                <ul>
                <li>Server Side (Application is hosted on Heroku PaaS Cloud Application Platform) </li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Server Application is written in Node/Express JS</li>
                        <li>Database backend is MongoDB</li>
                    </ul>

                <li>Client Application is written in HTML5/CSS and uses JavaScript for client side functionality</li>
                    <ul><li>The application (HTML Page) is served locally from a client computer</li></ul>

                </ul> 
            </p>

            <h4>Test system and Tools Used:</h4>
                
                <ul>
                <li>Browser details: Safari (updated to latest version)</li>
                <li>Mac OS Terminal 2.7.3 on Mac OS X Sierra (64 bit) for running shell script and Unix Tool CURL (POST Request)</li>

            <br>
            <h4> Preliminary functionality test of application:</h4>
            <p> The first stage of testing included running my colleague's application and checking if the implemented 
                functionality is generally in line with the specification requirements of Assignment 2, 3 mentioned above. This is 
                important because Black Box testing is done assuming the core functionality of a working app and by targeting
                common vulnerabilities related to the working app. 
            </p>
            <p>
                No major discrepancies found in app functionality. Client application (index.html) was launched locally from my computer.
                All landmarks & user markers were displayed (this implied operational server linkup); InfoWindow popup for Maps
                was functional. On the server side, /checkins.json and /sendLocation routes were also functional. Home Page
                hosted by server was also functional. I used Unix Tool Curl to send POST request with valid and invalid data, and 
                confirmed that data is being logged in MongoDB by utilizing MongLab online tool.

            <hr>
            <p>
            This application was found to be vulnerable to a number of security flaws. The application works as expected
            with valid user input that complies with the specifications; however, it can be easily compromised by erronous 
            or malicious user input which can deface or mutilate the Client Application Interface (API), and expose private data to theft.
            No special tools are required to exploit the above vulnerabilities: command line interface (CLI) available on 
            every computer and common web browsers are sufficient to administer the exploit payloads.
            A key takeaway is this:

                    <div> 
                    The application checks for out-of-range values for Latitude and Longitude values, but obviously invalid 
                    data is accepted into the database. This is not a major security issue but it affects the credibility of an app
                    and detracts from functionality when it displays obviously faulty information. As an example, with incorrect coordinate data entered manually
                    by using CURL within a Terminal Window, a user is placed in the middle of the ocean near Africa.
                    Furthermore, the database is currently modifiable by any unregistered user of this app. There is no 
                    validation of supplied login information and potentially devious agents are given full latitude (pun intended) 
                    to wreak havoc to the database.

                        The application program must check whether the queried parameter <code>login, latitude, longitude</code>  is of correct type and length

                        The application program must check and filter user input before inserting into database. Common escape characters could be used to negate the use of 
                        Javascript code or modified HTML code. For example, str.match(/[\<\>]/g) would  display string with those characters and this can be useful for filtering an XSS attempt.

                    According to <b>owasp.org </b>, 
                    Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks occur when:
                    Data enters a Web application through an untrusted source, most frequently a web request.
                    The data is included in dynamic content that is sent to a web user without being validated for malicious content.
                    <p>
                    I was able to inject scripts and thereby deface the application windows, redirect the user to another website, display
                    popup warnings etc; this was done by injecting the particular script into the login/longitude/latitude fields 
                    in the POST queries. By redirecting the user, I gained the ability to forward the user to innocuous looking
                    websites. Such websites could be expertly designed by an agent to use "social engineering" tricks or phishing to gain access to personal 
                    information like user logins and passwords.

                        The /checkins.json API is used to query the application for check-in information specific to a particular user.
                        The user's login is supplied as part of a GET request query string. But, the application code 
                        does not check for a valid string and allows MongoDB comparison queries to get through unchecked.
                        For example, $ne selects the documents where the value of the field is not equal (i.e. !=) to the specified value. 
                        This includes documents that do not contain the field. If I supplied an empty string for login, the [$ne] operator
                        returns the entire private database as a JSON object to the browser for viewing. This is a massive data breach 
                        and can be exploited easily by a malicious agent who doesn't even need to know any valid user logins. 
                        This is also considered a privacy issue as private user data is being revealed to the public.

                    I used a bash script to inject a multiline junk input in the login-field of POST query multiple times.
                    This faulty data was accepted by the Mongo Database. 
                    This is a type of database injection that can be used to carry out a DDOS attack. An arbitrary large amount of data can be
                    injected into a database millions of times, and the end-result is that the databasej
                    server/application can slow down or worse - be shutdown. As the free version of Heroku is used in this application which 
                    restricts storage consumption, I was hesitant to actually carry out the test as this could result in
                    excess-use billing for the app's owner.

                The main solution here is to check first and reject invalid login before proceeding to inserting into
                the database. Also, a field length restriction for string data input can be implemented, this will
                ignore and prevent large amounts of non-sense data being inserted.

            <hr>
            <p>
                This application was found to have a number of vulnerabilities mainly related to unchecked acceptance of
                3rd party user data. Some steps that can be taken are as follows: proper checking of valid user-ids (example keeping a whitelist of authorized logins), 
                checking data length and type for correct format, stripping special characters before storing in database. If you choose to proceed with fixing
                and launching this application on the web, I would recommend hiring an experienced pen-tester (or me after I take
                Mr. Ming's Security class at Tufts) for a detailed investigation that probes issues beyond user input validation.
